# DistributeurFX

First attempt to the Java FX examen.
List of objects with name & list of objects with name.
MVVM Structure.
4 hours maximum.

### Results

* 4h30 -> Possible to do under 4 hours.
* Too much printstacktrace / dead code / TODO -> need to read a last time before submitting.
* No javadoc -> crucial.

### Careful

* clear() to purge the current list when loading
* Crucial need to learn Savers & Loaders, how to open another window and how to manage listcells.
* Need to work again on very specific peace of codes.
